# Loading Final Fantasy Tactics into a Neo4j Database

When I started learning about databases in general, more than just Microsoft Access and Excel, I wanted to experiment with data to learn more. So when I was younger, I made a MySql database of my entire video game collection, and that helped me understand not just SQL statements and the SELECT, INSERT, etc, but it also helped me learn more about relationships, and what should go into a table, and what is repetitive enough to be in a separate table, and when to join and so on. For me, that was the best way to learn is to trial and error, and then you learn more from the errors.

Since I returned back to school in 2019 and learned about the other ways of learning how to store data, through MongoDb databases and Neo4J databases, I wanted to learn more about how they work, the advantages and disadvantages, and the benefits of using them over traditional databases.

So just like before, what better way to learn then to just throw data into the table and learn more about it.

And I found a data file from Kaggle that I knew I wanted to have fun. It's straight from the video game Final Fantasy Tactics, a "real time strategy" game for the original Playstation. The data set contains the information about the jobs available for all your characters, along with all the chapter stages information and the enemy jobs associated with it.

I know that the data needs to be improved on, and I welcome all feedback as to how I can improve my code, and more of what I can do in Neo4J to become better at databse data collection.

Note that the database I used is from a local machine because I can't afford to use the Neo4J sandbox just yet. ðŸ¤£
